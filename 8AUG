  Oracle -SQL- 

	1.	PseudoColumns:-
	•	   Fake columns (Virtual columns) 
	•	   It's not a column of a table,but you can use it in SELECT     statement.
E.g.
1)  Computed columns - this are never saved in tables.
   Ex : - (ANNUAL= sal*12)
2)  Expressions -  
   Ex : - (NET_EARNINGS =sal+comm) ->2 or more columns involved 
3)  Function-based columns 
   Ex : - (COMPANY_TOTAL= sum(sal)) - sum(sal) will give company total, so we see we don’t need this column in our table.

Oracle supplied PseudoColumns:-

RDBMS supplied Pseudo columns: -

select ename,sal from emp;

	1.	ROWNUM -> returns the row number---
    EXAMPLES: -
	•	select rownum, ename ,sal from emp;
	•	select rownum, ename, sal from emp where rownum = 1;  - it will show only whose rownum is 1
	•	select rownum, ename, sal from emp where rownum < 4; -  it will show only whose rownum is less than 4
	•	select rownum, ename, sal from emp where rownum = 4;  ----->it will give OUTPUT as no rownum bcz when rownum = 1 will enter it will not consider and ignore it and next rownum i.e rownum = 2 will enter and it will consider it 1 so again it will ignore so bcz of this it will show no rownum
	•	select rownum, ename, sal from emp where rownum > 4; ------> it will give OUTPUT as no rownum bcz SAME REASON AS ABOVE

select rownum,ename,sal from emp;

IF WE USE ROWNUM WITH ORDERBY(orderby clause does sorting and sorting takes place in last): -

     select rownum, ename, sal from emp order by ename;
          - this will not be I proper order bcz orderby clause does sorting and sorting takes place in last.

select rowname, ename, sal from
(select ename, sal from emp order by ename); - THIS IS A SUB-QUERY (it will execute first)

INLINE VIEW
      - If you use sub-query in the FROM clause,it is known as INLINE VIEW.
    EXAMPLE: -
select rowname, ename, sal from
(select ename, sal from emp order by ename); - THIS IS A SUB-QUERY (it will execute first)

	1.	ROW ID: - 

	•	* Rowid stands for Row Identifier. 
	•	* ROWID is the row address.
	•	* It is a address of the row in the DB server HD
	•	* (actual physical memory location where that row is stored)
	•	* Fixed length encrypted string of 18 characters
	•	* When you SELECT from a table, the order of rows in the output will be in ascending order of row address
	•	* When you SELECT from a ta ble, the order of rows in the output will be in ascending order of ROWID.
	•	* No two rows of any table in the entire DB can have same ROWID
	•	* ROWID works as unique identifier for every row in the DB
	•	* When you UPDATE a row,if the row length increasesthe ROWID may   change.
	•	* You can use ROWID to UPDATE or DELETE the duplicate rows.---VIMP...
	•	* Rowid is used internally by Oracle to distinguish between 2 rows in   the database.

select rowid, ename,sal from emp;

delete from emp where rowid='AAASSmAABAAAcG5AAA';

ROWID is used internally by the RDBMS: -(ORACLE)

	1.	To distinguish between 2 rows in the DB
	2.	For row locking
	3.	To manage the INDEXES
	4.	To manage the CURSORS
	5.	Row management

	▪	ROWID  and ROWNUM is present in Oracle and you can view it.
	▪	ROWID is present in MySQL but you cannot view it.
	▪	ROWNUM is not present in MySQL.

ALTER table: - (DDL command)
	•	Rename a table
	•	Add, drop a column to the table
	•	Increase width of column

INDIRECTLY: -
	•	Reduce width of column
	•	Change datatype of column
	•	Copy rows from one table into another table
	•	Copy a Table
	•	Copy Structure of Table
	•	Rename a Column
	•	Change Order of column in Table Structure [bcz of NULL VALUE as NULL value will take 1 BYTE and if we put column which has more no. of NULL value at end of the table it won’t occupy the space]

        
           EMP TABLE
empno ename sal
------ ------ -----
101 Scott 5000
102 King 6000

1. To Rename a Table
   QUERY: -  rename table emp to employees;         - BUT don’t use this QUERY

2. To add a Column
    QUERY: - alter table emp add get float;

3. Drop a Column
    QUERY: - alter table emp drop column sal;

4. Increase Width of the Column
    QUERY: - alter table emp modify ename varchar(30);

5. Reduce width of the column
 If we reduce the width of the table then the data will get TRUNCATED in MYSQL and ORACLE don’t allow reduction of width
    To reduce width we can do it INDIRECTLY: - [we can add another row and copy the data to that row]
QUERY: -
             alter table emp add x varchar(25);
             update emp set x = ename, ename = null;
             alter table emp modify ename varchar2(20);
        
      /* Data testing on x column */
      update emp set ename = x;
      alter table emp drop column x;
      insert into emp select * from emp2;

6. Change the Datatype of Column
QUERY: -
             alter table emp add x int;
             update emp set x = empno, empno = null;
             alter table emp modify empno char(4);
        
      /* Data testing on x column */
      update emp set empno = x;
      alter table emp drop column x;
      insert into emp select * from emp2;

TO copy specific rows only:-

insert into emp select * from emp2 where .......;

7. Copy a table (for testing purposes we copy Table)
QUERY: -  using Sub-query with create table [without using brackets]
          create table emp_copy      -it will copy structure, rows, columns
          as
          select * from emp;
                 This command works in 2 steps
                   Step 1 it will create a table
                   Step 2 it will select STATEMENT is executed 
                   OUTPUT won’t be shown on Screen it will be added to the table(emp_copy [table which we are creating])

8.To copy only specific columns/rows:-
QUERY: -
              create table emp_copy
              as
              select empno,sal from emp where......;

9.Copy structure of table (not rows)
QUERY: -
Method 1: -
         create table emp_struct as select * from emp;      - Copying the table
         delete from emp_struct;                                         - Deleting the table
         commit;

Method 2: -
         create table emp_struct as select * from emp;
         truncate table emp_struct;                                    - will DELETE all the rows and  COMMIT ALSO

Method 3: -
         create table emp_struct as
         select * from emp where 1 = 2; -> give an impossible[here 1 = 2 is the impossible condition] WHERE clause so that no row will get copied

10. Rename a column
QUERY: -
        create table emp2 as
        select ename, sal, empno from emp;
        
        drop table emp;

        rename table emp_copy to emp; -> In MySQL.   
                OR
        rename emp_copy to emp; -> In Oracle

Change position of columns in table structure
(because of null values, for storage conditions/consideration)



Difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE: -

            DELETE                                                         TRUNCATE
   1. DML command                                                DDL command 
               
   2. Requires COMMIT                                           Auto COMMIT

   3. ROLLBACK possible                                        ROLLBACK not possible

   4. Can use WHERE clause with DELETE           Cannot use WHERE clause with  TRUNCATE

   5. Free space is not deallocated                          Free space is deallocated

   6. When you delete the rows delete                     When you truncate a table delete
       triggers on table will                                          tables on triggers will not
        execute.                                                           execute.

   7. you can specify WHERE clause                      You cannot specify WHERE clause (truncate will delete all the rows a DELETE        
                                                                                 speicific rows only   committ).

   8. Free space is not deallocated                           free space is  deallocated.

   9. Delete Triggers written on table.                       Delete Triggers written on table will not execute 
    will execute
